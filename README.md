> This repository is a **public log** of my journey into Python and core Computer Science concepts — everything from writing `if-else` statements to building **logic-heavy mini projects** that lay the foundation for **AI & Quantitative Finance**.

## 📚 What's Inside

This GitHub profile hosts multiple repos focused on:

- 🔁 **Control Flow** (loops, conditions, logic)
- 🧠 **Functions & Recursion**
- 🧪 **Mini Projects** (Blackjack, Calculator, etc.)
- 📊 **Coming soon:** DS/Algo visualizations + AI-Finance prototypes

Each project and concept comes with:

- ✅ **Detailed explanations**
- 📌 **Well-commented code**
- 🧩 **Problem-solving breakdowns**
- 🧠 **Real-world extensions**

## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hey! I’m **Shivam Malge** — a CSE undergrad exploring:

- 🤖 Machine Learning and Data Science
- 💹 Quantitative Finance & Market Simulation
- 🧱 System Design and Full-Stack Dev

This profile is a **sandbox** for learning, documenting, and experimenting.

## 🧠 Why This Exists

Most beginner projects online are either:
- Too simple (just "Hello World" clones), or
- Too abstract (built with no real understanding).

My goal with this GitHub is to **bridge that gap** — by writing code that’s:

- ✍️ **Beginner-friendly**
- 🧩 **Logically rich**
- 🔄 **Extendable to real-world applications**

## 🔍 Project Example: Blackjack Mini Game

A logic-based simulation of the Blackjack card game where you’ll learn:

- 🔁 **Loops & Conditionals**
- 🧮 **Score calculation with edge cases**
- 🂡 **Card simulation using dictionaries**
- 👥 **User interaction: hit or stand**
- 🃏 **Ace handling (1 or 11 logic)**
